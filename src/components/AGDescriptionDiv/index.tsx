                    the wealthy have escaped to airborne cities, leaving the poor to survive in the scorched ruins below. 
                    You are a scavenger — a member of the Sandwalkers Guild — risking your life to collect vital resources 
                    from the remnants of the old world. After a devastating crash, you're stranded in the wasteland. 
                    To return home, you'll need to repair your ship, survive the chaos, and prove your worth in a 
                    world where only the toughest endure.
